##Brief Description
Our data analysis started with collating and cleaning the voluminous transactional data collected over the past 20 months. Following that, given the wealth of data and the limitless scope of analysis possible, our goal was to tackle an urgent yet relevant sub-issue within the health domain. After a few rounds of meetings and discussion with health officials and experts at the government, it was unanimously agreed upon to focus on maternal and neo-natal healthcare. Once the data was cleaned, the topic of analysis narrowed in on, and time reference frame selected (owing to implementation complexities), we were eager to explore the data and let it reveal beyond the anecdotal and the intuitive.

One of the main objectives of the BSBY is stated to be the provision of private sector facilities in rural Rajasthan. On that basis, it was imperative to study the distribution of care-giving burden between government and private hospitals across the state â€“ made up of 33 districts that are clustered into 7 divisions. We found out that across all districts across Rajasthan, barring a few outliers, government hospitals were predominantly responsible for providing a much higher proportion of services than private hospitals.
